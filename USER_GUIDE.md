## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! The system uses:
- Encrypted passwords
- Secure connections
- Regular backups (by admin)
- User access controls

**Q: Can I access this from my phone?**
A: Yes! The system is mobile-responsive. However, for the best experience, we recommend using a laptop or desktop computer.

**Q: Can multiple people use the system at once?**
A: Yes! Multiple users can be logged in and working simultaneously.

**Q: What happens if I lose internet connection?**
A: You can still view data you've already loaded (it's cached locally), but you won't be able to save new data or load new information until your connection is restored.

**Q: How do I get my own account?**
A: Contact your system administrator. They can create an account for you.

### Client Management

**Q: Can I have multiple contacts for one client?**
A: Currently, you can list one primary contact person. For additional contacts, add them to the notes field or contact your admin about custom requirements.

**Q: What if I don't have a client's logo?**
A: That's fine! The logo is optional. You can add it later when you get it.

**Q: Can I merge duplicate clients?**
A: Not automatically. Contact your admin to manually merge client records.

### Campaign Management

**Q: How many images can I upload per campaign?**
A: You can upload multiple images for both creative and evidence. There's no hard limit, but we recommend keeping it reasonable for performance (10-20 images per campaign).

**Q: What if I don't know all the metrics yet?**
A: You can save a campaign with partial data and edit it later to add metrics as they become available.

**Q: Can I copy a campaign?**
A: Not currently. You'll need to create a new campaign and manually enter the details.

### Content & Finance

**Q: What's the difference between Content and Campaigns?**
A: 
- **Content** = Creative pieces you produce (posts, graphics, videos)
- **Campaigns** = Paid advertising campaigns (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, etc.)

**Q: Who can add payments?**
A: Only Admin users can add, edit, or delete payment records for security reasons.

**Q: Can I track payments in different currencies?**
A: Currently, the system uses a single currency (Rs). Contact your admin about multi-currency support.

### Reports & Invoices

**Q: Can I customize the invoice template?**
A: The basic layout is fixed, but you can customize:
- Company information
- Logo
- Payment terms
- Notes section

**Q: Can I email reports directly from the system?**
A: Not currently. Generate the PDF and email it using your email client.

**Q: How long are invoices kept in the system?**
A: Invoices are stored indefinitely unless manually deleted by an admin.

### Technical Questions

A: 
- ✅ Google Chrome (recommended)
- ✅ Mozilla Firefox
- ✅ Microsoft Edge
- ✅ Safari
- ❌ Internet Explorer (not supported)

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**
A: No! It's a web-based system. Just use your browser.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: You can view previously loaded data, but you need internet to save changes or load new data.

**Q: What if I find a bug?**
A: Report it to your system administrator with:
